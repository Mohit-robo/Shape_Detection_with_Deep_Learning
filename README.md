# Shape Recognition with Deep Learning

This Repository contains files related to Shape Recognition Technique built using Deep Learning techniques.
##  Installation

    Python 3.8 +

    Tensorflow== 2.6.0

    Tensorflow-gpu == 2.6.0

    Opencv == > 4.5

    Keras == 2.6.0

    Numpy


    
## Setup

    pip install tensorflow==2.6.0

    pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.6.0

    pip install keras==2.6.0

    pip install opencv-python

    pip install streamlit

Open command prompt and move 
to the project directory.

Setup for Virtual Environment:

    py -m pip install --user virtualenv

Create Virtual Environment

    python3 -m venv < “ name of environment”> // for linux users

    py -m venv < “ name of environment”> // for windows users

Activating a virtual environment

    source <“ name of environment”>/bin/activate // Linux

    .<“ name of environment”>\Scripts\activate   // Windows
  
“ Now you have to install all of the above mentioned libraries in this virtual environment and use it for this project ”


##  Demo

Clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/Mohit-robo/Shape_Detection_with_Deep_Learning

Unzip the data_set.rar

    cd Shape_Detection_with_Deep_Learning

    cmd  

    >> py -m pip install --user virtualenv 

    >> Create Virtual Environment 

    >> Activating a virtual environment 

    >> jupyter notebook
    
"""

Open jupyter notebook if you want to train a model of your's.

"""

   OR

Lets run the app:

    streamlit run web_deployment.py

This will open a web page select the image 
and try classification with different images.
